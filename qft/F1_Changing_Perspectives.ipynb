    "In this node, we will change gears and discuss the basics of the classical Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which has made a significant impact in the field of signal processing for transforming data from the time domain to the frequency domain and back. The DFT is a unitary transformation, which makes it a good candidate for quantum computers. But before we discuss the Quantum Fourier transform, let's understand how the classical DFT works using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. We can demonstrate the ingenuity of the FFT by using it to solve the problem of polynomial multiplication.\n",
